### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently an R&D data scientist at Optum Labs
- I'm passionate about human health and creating system-level impacts on healthcare delivery in the US!
- I'm also a student at the U of MN in the data science master's program, minoring in data science in multi-messenger astrophysics...because, why not?
